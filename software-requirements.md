## Software Requirements

### Vision

What is the vision of this product?

<p> To help find and narrow down what could lead to a cure for malaria, including different ways to deliver medications. </p>

What pain point does this project solve?

<p>A team of malaria researchers who pulled down all this data and they don't know how to analyze this. They want our help.</p>

Why should we care about your product?

<p>Over 1,300 children die per day of malaria. This is a major issue. </p>

### Scope (In/Out)

IN - What will your product do? 
Describe the individual features that your product will do.
High overview of each. Only need to list 4-5:

- Answer the research questions with appropriate data visualizations:  
1. What proteins are enriched in SPP vs. NAT?
2. Do protein modifications differ between SPP vs. NAT?
3. Are specific pathways/GO terms enriched in SPP vs. NAT?
4. In what peptides does the previous amino acid not = K or R... does this differ between SPP vs. NAT?
5. Are transmembrane domains enriched in the SPP vs. NAT peptides?

- These will be notebooks in Kaggle. 


OUT - What will your product not do.

- We will not be implementing any type of full stack development, not an interactive application. 


These should be features that you will make very clear from the beginning that you will not do during development. These should be limited and very few. Pick your battles wisely. This should only be 1 or 2 things. Example: My website will never turn into an IOS or Android app.

### Minimum Viable Product vs

What will your MVP functionality be?

- That we will be able to tell a story about the dataset. We are very excited! 

What are your stretch goals?

<p>Continue our research and find additional questions to answer</p>

### Stretch
What stretch goals are you going to aim for?

<p>Continue our research and find additional questions to answer</p>
<p> Potential to explore testability for the data, including the machine learning aspect </p>

### Functional Requirements

A presentation on the dataset and draws conclusions based upon a dataset, and demonstrated via the visualizations. 


## Data Flow

Describe the flow of data in your application. Write out what happens from the time the user begins using the app to the time the user is done with the app. Think about the “Happy Path” of the application. Describe through visuals and text what requests are made, and what data is processed, in addition to any other details about how the user moves through the site.

- Importing the data directly from the original research provided to us via the researchers at Washington University.  

- Frame the dataset in the context of the research.

- Explain the dataset. 

- We will explore the dataset. 

- We will clean the dataset. 

## Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)

- Security --We will be mindful of the original dataset, but we will be able to share our results. 

- Data integrity--we will data profile and clean the dataset

- Collaboration--effective communication, sharing of insights, and teamwork! 

- Scalability--analysis should be able to handle increasing amounts of data
