What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Bring up to the individual that they are taking over the project and escalate if necessary. Try to mitigate via assigning certain tasks to people. 


How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Empathy and understanding for each team member. Help each other with team stand-ups and paired programming. Reach out to TAs/Instructors when necessary.

See answer #2. If a member is not contributing, bring it up to them. And escalate if necessary. Assigning tasks and articulating what needs to be done.
